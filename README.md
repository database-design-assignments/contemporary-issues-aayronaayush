This document looks at two artizzzcles about data breaches, one article that addresses data breach due to the lack care on the user's side and the other articles looks at data breach of user information.

### [Data Breaches Keep Happening. So Why Donâ€™t You Do Something?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/data-breaches.html)

The articles speaks about the data breaches that have been occurring and human behavior associated with data protection. The article begins by listing a few major database breaches. These examples were included UnderArmour's MyFitnessPal app data breach, Timehop data breach and the data breach at Yahoo in 2013. The articles says that users would not change their behavior unless they have been involved in a data breach or have lost precious data like photos.

I agree with what the articles outlines. It is common human behavior that as long as something is working there is not need to change the way things are working. The same goes for their password [the article states that users tend to reuse the same password for multiple account so that they only have to memorize a single password]. This method of reusing a single password works well for users and as such they don't deem it necessary to change the way their passwords are handled. Another reason why user don't consider using a password manager [which was suggested as a solution for password management] is because the way password managers are integrated into systems and processes is messy. Sometimes password managers are not triggered on mobile devices when prompted for password or cross platform integration and password access process is often tedious. Due to such reasons users often find it easier to memorize and use a single password.

### [Data breach hits 30,000 signed up to workplace pensions provider](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/23/data-breach-hits-30000-signed-up-to-workplace-pensions-provider)

The article by the NY Times about data breaches looked at data breaches from the stand point that users are at fault. The news reports by the Guardian is about a data breach by a pension company which saw information of 30000 members who signed up for the service leaked on a public forum. The information leaked include information that could personally identify the individual such as _"names, postal and email addresses, birth dates and National Insurance numbers."_

The NY Article stated that data breaches occur due to the lack of care by users however, what happens when data breach leaks personal information. If a password is leaked, at most most the attacker or the beneficiary of the information is able to gain access to a few online accounts. However, when a data breach like the one that happened at Now:Pensions occurs a lot more damage can be done. For instance because the user's name, date of birth, email and postal address and National Insurance Numbers were leaked, a person with such information can easily go through the phone verification process and gain access to users data and can in turn cause a lot more damage.
